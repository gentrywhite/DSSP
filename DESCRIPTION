Description: This package contains the functions necessary to draw samples from the direct sampling spatial prior model (DSSP) in White et. al. 2019.  The basic model assumes a Gaussian likelihood and derives a spatial prior based on thin-plate splines.  Functions are included so that the model can be extended to be used for generalised linear mixed models or Bayesian Hierarchical Models.
