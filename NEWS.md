# DSSP 0.1.1

* Fixed some minor typo in the plots created by `plot.dsspMod()` and added a title to the covariates grid plot.

* Updated vignette and README to use `plot()` and `summary()` in examples.

* Use `{interp}` instead of `{akima}` for contour plots due to licensing.


# DSSP 0.1.0

This is the first release of **DSSP** to CRAN.

DSSP provides functions to draw samples from the direct sampling spatial prior model. The model assumes a Gaussian likelihood and derives a spatial prior based on thin-plate splines.
